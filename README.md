# My portfolio website

This is currently being overhauled.
Majority of the codebase has been wiped off/dumped in favour of a more simpler static site generator, with some dynamic elements and more control over the infra itself.

## What has changed
- Moved away from frameworks such as react in favour of a SSG (Hugo) with some custom html/js templating.
- Still on AWS, but moved a lot of the components to more open source solutions.
- More details will come later

I like infra, and I would like to control more of it. Thats basically the gist of it.
