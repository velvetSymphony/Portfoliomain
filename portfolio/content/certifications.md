As mentioned in my [about](https://{base_url}/certifications), I have achieved the following certifications:
- AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate (AWS SAA CO2)
- Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA)

What I liked about these certifications is that they provided me with a decent enough knowledge to start
off working in the cloud and also more generally, improved my understanding of IT concepts in general.

The way I like to see it, is that certifications are merely a `side-effect` of the ultimate purpose: which
is to understand the fundamentals, the concepts and apply them in your own personal projects. 
Ofcourse, this does take into consideration the fact that you'll spend a lot more time understanding it, but the pay offs are
much better in the long term (rather than trying to `brute-force` your way through certifications). 
These are just my opinions though, YMMV.
