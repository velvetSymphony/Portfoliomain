Enthusiastic about all things tech, I especially love to read and discuss various musings in and around the 
topics of systems, programming, networks and SRE/DevOpsy stuff. 
With a passion for building scalable, maintanable and resilient systems, 
I've spent many a day fine-tuning servers, orchestrating cloud infrastructure, attempting to understand what happens 
when I perform git operations, deciphering and writing magic spells (scripts/programs) to automate basically as much of my job as I can.

I'm a masters graduate from the University of New South Wales, Australia in the field of Telecommunications. 
I thought it was good, but then I realised I liked the cloud and networks a tad bit more, thanks to my uni courses. It was like deciding
to choose between pizza and pizza with extra cheese (unless you hate the extra cheese...in which case ignore what I just said).

Since then, I've moved onto the more finer things in tech, like meetings.

I also have a CCNA and AWS SAA-C02 certifications, preparing for
which I found to be rather decent approaches to learning more about general technical concepts in IT. 

In my free time, I usually like to go on day hikes and admiring pictures of Mountains in the himalayas (where I dream everyday of going). 
I do enjoy doing tech stuff in my time off. You can find some (pretty useless) projects I work on at [my github](https://github.com).
