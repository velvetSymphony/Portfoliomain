Enthusiastic about all things tech, I especially love to read and discuss various musings in and around the 
topics of systems, programming, networks and topics that explore the priciples of SRE and DevOps. 
With a passion for building scalable, maintanable and resilient systems, 
I've spent many a day fine-tuning servers, orchestrating cloud infrastructure, attempting to understand what happens 
when I perform git operations, deciphering and writing magic spells (scripts/programs) to automate basically as much of my job as I can.

I'm a masters graduate from the University of New South Wales, Australia in the field of Telecommunications. 
It was an alright course, but what I'm genuinely thankful for my time at uni was when I was introduced to *software defined networking* and cloud computing.
Not that I ended up learning about AWS or anything, but it was a good beginning and one that defintely left an impression on me, making me dig further.
Those couple courses had the right ingredients of all the stuff I enjoyed; networking, AWS, some linux and python. It was hard to go back to just traditional networking at that point, let alone telecommunications.

What started as a personal curiosity for me turned into a full-blown career in cloud computing. 
I practically lived and breathed the cloud, spending countless hours learning the ropes and getting hands-on with some of the coolest technologies. 
This also helped me prepare for the CCNA and AWS SAA-C02 certifications, which I found to be good approaches to learning more about general technical concepts in IT (more about that in [certifications](./certifications )). 

I'm at a stage where this does not feel like just a job for me; it's a passion that keeps me hooked on the constant innovation and possibilities in the ever-expanding universe of IT.
Ofcourse someday I'll look back at this statement and reminisce about my youthful exuberance, but until then, 
I thrive on the excitement of exploring uncharted territories and watch the boundaries of what's possible being pushed (I hope to be part of the pushing myself at some point). 

What I really like about IT is the dynamic nature of things; there's always something new to discover. Being part of this industry feels like a perpetual state of euphoria sometimes ( or a perpetual state of desolation depending on who you ask ;) ) 
And sometimes, the thrill of it is to just watch and observe what ideas evolve into over time.

In my free time, I usually like to go on day hikes and admiring pictures of mountains in the himalayas (where I dream of going everyday).
I do plan on maybe getting a blog page up for writing up some trip reports for my hikes, it sounds like a fun thing to do.
It could also be useful for if and when I eventually go on to bigger/longer treks ([Annapurna Circuit coming up!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annapurna_Circuit)).
I do enjoy doing tech stuff in my time off as well. You can find some (pretty useless) projects I work on at [my github](https://github.com).
