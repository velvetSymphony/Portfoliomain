Enthusiastic about all things tech, I especially love to read and discuss various musings in and around the 
topics of systems, programming, networks and SRE/DevOpsy stuff. 
With a passion for building scalable, maintanable and resilient systems, 
I've spent many a day fine-tuning servers, orchestrating cloud infrastructure, attempting to understand what happens 
when I perform git operations, deciphering and writing magic spells (scripts/programs) to automate basically as much of my job as I can.

I'm a masters graduate from the University of New South Wales, Australia in the field of Telecommunications. 
I thought it was good, but what I'm genuinely thankful for my time at uni was when I was introduced to *software defined networking* and the "cloud" (I know...buzzwords).
There were only 2-3 courses that went into any sort of depth with regards to those topics, 
but that alone was sufficient to get me hooked into IT in general.
 
Since then, I've moved onto the more finer things in tech, like meetings.

I also have a CCNA and AWS SAA-C02 certifications, preparing for
which I found to be rather decent approaches to learning more about general technical concepts in IT (more about that in ./certifications). 

In my free time, I usually like to go on day hikes and admiring pictures of mountains in the himalayas (where I dream of going everyday). 
I do enjoy doing tech stuff in my time off as well. You can find some (pretty useless) projects I work on at [my github](https://github.com).
