My [github](https://github.com/velvetSymphony) has some of the stuff I've worked on/attempted to work on. I think the one single project I'm really
interested in setting up is basically a trekking preparation tool, which I thought would be a good idea given I've had to prepare for a lengthy one 
recently. This is a fairly big one and I anticipate that I'll restart it sometime this year once again (hopefully!). I will need to rewrite some of the 
docs and also the tools I'm using, but otherwise excited to get that going. 

Feel free to also have a look at my dotfiles, although I'm willing to bet that most of you already have a much better setup. It is very much a work in progress
and I hope to keep filling it up with more of such config files.

As mentioned in my [about](https://{base_url}/certifications), I have achieved the following certifications:
- [AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate (AWS SAA CO2)](https://www.credly.com/badges/449f21be-fa89-4291-b641-abbd8f070611/public_url)
- [Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA)](https://www.credly.com/badges/80b37738-5cdb-466b-894c-cc62de7a3b5c/public_url)

What I liked about these certifications is that they provided me with a decent enough knowledge to start
off working in IT and also more generally, improved my understanding of concepts and technologies used in the IT world.
I won't really go into too much detail about how I prepared for these, there's already lots of resources out there that will
help people get started. I think though, that how much of this knowledge actually transfers over into work depends on how you prepare for one.

I did make the mistake of just studying for these, until I actually applied the concepts I had learnt into my own projects, 
amplifying my understanding of how the services worked and interacted with each other. This was definitely the difference maker.
As an example, this website currently is being run on AWS :D (and the way I learnt to do it was to integrate this piece of project into my personal learning for certifications).

I also think that the [70-20-10 model](https://trainingindustry.com/wiki/content-development/the-702010-model-for-learning-and-development/) is a great introduction and reasoning
to why you should try spending a lot of time doing hands-on activities and projects to boost your learning. This has definitely helped me re-shape my perspective on how I learn and
what methods are effective for me.

Having said all that, this does take into consideration the fact that you'll spend a lot more time understanding it, but I feel that the pay offs are
much better in the long term. 

For the future, I intend on obtaining the AWS developer associate and the AWS sysops associate ones.
