# Hey Hey
Welcome to my portfolio. I'm Abhishek and I work full-time as a DevOps Engineer at [Versent Pty Ltd](https://versent.com.au/).

Mention any of the topics below if you want me to appear out of the bush like [homer here...](https://imgur.com/gallery/Pu8EvaA)

- Automation
    - Python scripting
    - Shell scripting
- Linux
- The "Cloud" (Brownie points if they're AWS and Azure)
- Git (love this piece of magic)
- Networks (Death, taxes, packet loss)
- Security
- Monitoring and Observability
- Other buzz words like DevOps, Platform and SRE I guess
- Did I mention `Vim`? (I use Vim btw)
- Alpine Trekking
    - Bonus points if its High Altitude adventuring in and around the Himalayas.
