# Hey Hey
Welcome to my portfolio. I'm Abhishek and I work full-time as a DevOps Engineer at [Versent Pty Ltd](https://versent.com.au/).

Mention any of the topics below if you want me to appear out of the blue like [homer here...](https://imgur.com/gallery/Pu8EvaA)
Oh and also, this acts as my list of skills/what I consider myself to be decent at:

- Automation
    - Python scripting
    - Shell scripting
    - I also enjoy writing code in Ruby
    - Basic Powershell
- Server Management (Linux, Windows)
- The "Cloud" (AWS/Azure)
    - Compute, Networking, Security, Dev and Devops services.
- Git
- Networks (I love all layers of the OSI model equally)
- Security (More network security like SSL and implementation of cryptographic algorithms for symmetric/asymmetric key exchanges and hashing)
- Monitoring and Observability
- Ticket and Incident Management.
- Other buzz words like DevOps, Platform and SRE I guess and everything along with it:
    - Cloudformation, Azure BICEP
    - Docker
    - AWS Codebuild, CodeCommit, CodePipeline
    - Platform stuff.
- Virtualisation
- ***Vim***

In all honesty, there's probably more things that interest me, but I forget (a more up-to-date list can be found in my resume).

Other topics that also pique my interest very much are...
- Alpine Trekking/Mountaineering
    - Bonus points if its High Altitude adventuring in and around the Himalayas.
- Music
    - Enjoy all kinds, especially melodious electronic.
- Sports
    - Football (the real one) is probably what I follow the most, though I'm interested in anything.
